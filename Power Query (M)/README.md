# Power Query (M) Data Transformations

## Overview
Many business teams rely on Excel, Power BI, and other Microsoft tools to make decisions. Power Query :

* Automates manual data preparation work
* Reduces reporting errors caused by copy-paste workflows
* Makes data refreshes predictable and repeatable
* Improves trust in dashboards and reports

Well-written Power Query logic allows teams to spend less time fixing data and more time analyzing it.
